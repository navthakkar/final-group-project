   					<h2>Adrian Oh</h2>
   					<p>Adrian Oh is an artist and art archivist whose main area of interest is in documenting visual resources and artist materials. Through the use of descriptive metadata, cataloging practices, and digitization methods, he aims to work with artist collections, archives, and non-book media to further contextualize artists and their work. He is most interested in the documentation processes that go behind cataloging singular items such as artists' sketches, notes, correspondence, and estate records. In his free time, Adrian also records and documents longplays of live-service games for documentation and preservation purposes. He received his BFA in Studio Art at New York University and will receive his MSLIS from Pratt Institute in 2024.</p>
   					<p>His responsibilities for the project include recording and outlining the research process for the project as a whole. He wrote the page "About the Project" on the website. He also assisted in the questionnaire development for the interview portion of the project, and conducted an interview with a public librarian for use on the "Interview" page of the website. He performed several usability tests including accessibility testing, digital rights, and content acquisition. He then wrote the portions of the Libby/SimplyE/Hoopla usability test pages on the website that pertain to those tests.</p>
