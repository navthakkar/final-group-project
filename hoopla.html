		   			<p>introduction to software + its use</p>

		   			<h2>Testing for Accessibility:</h2>
		   			<p><em>We explored different accessibility features and applied filters to determine the how accessible the software is.</em></p>
		   			<p>Hoopla's app does not feature any accessibility options or tools for its home page, but it functions with a screen reader for all categories and buttons. The default UI features high contrast white on dark blue, although some of the text can be quite small and doesn't scale based off of phone text settings (Hoopla1 image) Some text is light gray on white, which can be difficult to read for people with vision impairments. After selecting a title, the text becomes much larger and easier to read.</p>
		   			<p>After opening a book, the text defaults to a blue on white background (Hoopla2 image). A total of 15 different fonts can be selected, with each font having an additional bold option. The font list includes "dyslexic", which is weighted to help with readability for dyslexic people. Text size can also be adjusted on a sliding scale of 20 options. Unlike Libby and SimplyE, Hoopla offers four different color themes- white, light gray, dark, and sepia. All options feature high contrast for readability, and all function well with grayscale color settings. Line spacing, margin size, and text alignment can all be adjusted from three different options. Hoopla is also functional with screen readers.</p>

		   			<h2>Reviewing UI:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Reviewing aesthetic and graphic choices for consistently designed user interface.</em></p>
		   			<p><em>Note, Hoopla also offers music and television, which have distinct interfaces from its ebook content, however, this analysis will not discuss these features to ensure consistency across various app testing.<br> Note: this portion of usability testing was conducted by a member of the team who accessed the app in their capacity as a Jersey City Free Public Library cardholder.</em></p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Font:</span> The font used for menus and page content is easily readable.  The same or a similar font is used for all content.  Notably the selected font, is very similar, if not identical, to the fonts used as the default for other popular applications, such as spotify, and instagram.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Use of Graphics:</span> The app uses a play button icon overlaid on ebooks in the user's “borrowed items” page to indicate that users can click on them to begin reading. Overall, the app used graphics such as a house for the home button, a gear for settings, and a heart icon for favorites, and a magnifying glass for search which are similar to icons used in social media apps, or in iOS.  The app includes text descriptors for navigational options on navigational screens.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Consistency of Design:</span> The app contains multiple collection carousels, which consistently must be swiped through to see further content. The navigation tools provided within ebooks, including scrolling options, the bookmark tool, etc., are consistent, regardless of the publisher of the resource. The app uses both an X icon and a back arrow icon to exit pages, inconsistently.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Use of Color:</span> The app’s interface uses a limited color palette, displaying content in black, grey, white, and light blue, while content covers’ images are displayed in full color. Notably, when the app is viewed via a phone on “dark mode” light blue content, including category and return buttons, are not recolored, and are visually unattractive, and difficult to read on dark screens. The color blue is frequently used to indicate linked content, or additional pages, however, the color distinction is problematically the only visual indicator of linked content. Interestingly, the book rating option contained on each book’s page uses a pop containing yellow star emojis, a choice which is visually inconsistent with the rest of the application.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Additional Comments:</span> The app features a carousel of collections on its homepage which moves between options extremely quickly. It was not possible to change this feature in the app. It was also not clear, except by trial and error that users could click on these banners to be directed to content. Notably, a pop up to rate hoopla the app appears whenever users borrow a new item. Significantly, it was not possible to change the visual appearance of the app in the app’s settings. However, the visual appearance of books could be modified while reading, to different brightness levels, and color themes, ie., exclusively black and white, dark mode, or sepia-tone pages, which differed from the sometimes colorful publisher default option.  It is also impossible to remove a function from in-content page menu which indicates the remaining percent of the book or remaining number of pages in the chapter. Images within texts display in-line, and sized appropriately with text. They can also be clicked on and zoomed into, although image quality is low.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Overall Impressions:</span> Overall, with some previously noted exceptions, the app provides users with an aesthetically consistent experience. The limited color palette and font used by the app may be appealing to some users, depending on their personal use and preferences. The aesthetic choices and graphics used by the app, such as the font choice, and the graphics utilized, such as the play icon and settings gear do not distinguish the app from other content and social media applications. For some users, this may be helpful, because the user interface may feel familiar to frequent app users. For others, the app’s aesthetic may not distinguish it as a tool specifically created for library content.</p>

		   			<h2>Reviewing UX:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Reviewing the user experience of the software and the design decisions that contributed.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Testing Across Devices:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Understanding how the software design is impacted when viewing on different devices such as mobile, tablet, or desktop.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Content Acquisition & Digital Rights Management:</h2>
		   			<p>Hoopla's title availability is managed based off of publisher availability, usage, library pricing, and requests from both libraries and their patrons. Hoopla's e-book service is based on a transactional model, where e-books will always be instantly available with no holds, and the publisher is paid every time a book is checked out. There are no complicated licenses, expirations, or platform fees, and libraries only pay for content that their users are actually accessing. In 2019, Hoopla expanded their service to include several different models to include metered and perpetual access models. Some content is protected only with DRM (digital rights management), HGCP (high-bandwidth digital content protection), or both. </p>

		   			<h2>Non-English Language Use:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Availability of translations within the software.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Ease of Use:</h2>
			   		<em><ul>Analyzing the ease of use of the software by conducting a set of specific tasks outlined below:
			   			<li>Browse books, search a specific book, and borrow it</li>
			   			<li>Create a bookmark</li>
			   			<li>Exit the software and to same page in the book you were reading</li>
			   			<li>Try to find the borrowing limit and max it out</li>
			   			<li>Return a book</li>
						<li>Examine data for borrowing history and attempt to delete that data</li>
		   			</ul></em>
