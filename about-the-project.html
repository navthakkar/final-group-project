		   			<p>Our project began as an assignment to create a website focused on original content based on information technologies. As a group, we began by brainstorming a list of potential topics, which included cataloging software analysis, technology usability, and post-pandemic shifts in information technology. We decided from the beginning that our project would be best served with a custom-coded website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but we knew that we needed to narrow down our topic.</p>

		   			<p>In order to do this, we first met with Professor Rachel Daniell and Pratt E-Resources Librarian Matthew Garklavs. Through our interview with Matt, we were able to narrow down our research focus to evaluating software used to disseminate digital content such as ebooks and audiobooks, which will now be referred to with the term "e-readers". Our discussion with Matt led to various questions such as why different libraries pushed different e-readers, accessibility concerns and digital rights management differences between e-readers. Matt gave our group more information on ebook licensing and typical user concerns as well as directing us to various resources such as Urban Librarians Unite, ACRL/NY, and Pratt's E-Resource Evaluation Policy.</p>

		   			<p>Our group decided to focus our project by comparing and contrasting differences between different e-readers, namely Libby, SimplyE, ProQuest, and Adobe Digital Editions. We decided to collectively draft a questionnaire and interview public librarians from different library branches in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Jersey City in order to gather data on e-reader usage in public libraries. To supplement this, we also planned to perform usability tests of the aforementioned technologies from a user perspective.</p>

		   			<p>The three of us visited an NYPL branch and interviewed two librarians with our questionnaire draft. Our questions mostly consisted of e-reader choice, factors in e-reader choice, frequent user pain points, and changes in patrons' needs as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the interview, we collected feedback from the librarians in order to further refine our questionnaire, mostly by clarifying key terms and rethinking our strategy to secure reference interviews. </p>

		   			<p>To view the final interview questionnaire drafted for this study, click <a href="interview-questionnaire.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. We then split and went on to interview each of our local branches, eventually collecting enough data to draw an anecdotal conclusion of how different library branches viewed the technologies that support accessing digital content in libraries.</p>

		   			<p>With our interviews finalized, we shifted our focus to the usability testing portion of our project. We began by choosing the apps we wanted to test, outlining several dimensions for testing, and assigning each dimension to a person. Sample dimensions include accessibility, UI/UX, content acquisition, language features, and ease of use. At first, we chose to evaluate the apps Libby, SimplyE, and Adobe Digital Editions. We then decided to add ProQuest into our research study, but ended up deciding against it due to ProQuest not having an app. We replaced it with Hoopla, and commenced our testing. However, after we began, we were made aware of the fact that Adobe Digital Editions functioned differently than the other three apps, as it was mostly designed to import files instead of having browsing features. Coupled with the difficulties logging into and accessing the app, we decided to also scrap this and ended up with a list of three final apps for our usability tests - Libby, Hoopla, and SimplyE. We finalized our tests, making sure to record our findings for use on our website.</p>

		   			<p>It was at this point that our website began to take shape. As we compiled our findings from our interviews and usability tests, we decided how we wanted to organize the content into various pages on our website, as well as the general aesthetics and design of the website. After finishing the programming, we inserted all of the content that we had worked on over the course of the project and completed our webpage, which covers the different technologies behind accessing digital content in libraries, comparisons between their different features, and anecdotal opinion pieces from current librarians.</p>
