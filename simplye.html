		   			<p>introduction to software + its use</p>

		   			<h2>Testing for Accessibility:</h2>
		   			<p><em>We explored different accessibility features and applied filters to determine the how accessible the software is.</em></p>
		   			<p>SimplyE's app does not feature any accessibility options or tools for its home page, but it functions with a screen reader for all categories and buttons. The text size scales based off of screen size, with a relatively generous font size. However, the text color is somewhat low contrast compared to the background, leading to possible difficulties reading it without any additional options.</p>
		   			<p>After opening a book, SimplyE offers a choice of three color schemes- dark, light,and sepia. Font size can be scaled up or down between 8 different sizes, and brightness settings can also be adjusted. There is an option between three different fonts- serif, sans serif, and OpenDyslexic as well as the publisher's default. However, there are no options for line spacing or font weight. However, SimplyE is compatible with screen readers, and the text within the books is high contrast and easily distinguishable from its background in all 3 color schemes. When run through the red/green, blue/yellow, and grayscale color filters, all of the results appeared clearly.</p>

		   			<h2>Reviewing UI:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Reviewing aesthetic and graphic choices for consistently designed user interface.</em></p>
		   			<p><em>Note: this portion of usability testing was conducted by a member of the team who accessed the app in their capacity as a Jersey City Free Public Library cardholder.</em></p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Font:</span> The app uses legible fonts, which are identical or similar across the platform. Notably the selected font, is very similar, if not identical, to the fonts used as the default for other popular applications, such as spotify, and instagram.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Use of Graphics:</span> The app utilizes very sparse graphics- the app’s navigational menu features a gear, e-book page, and column-building, such as that which is often used to indicate an institution or repository as graphics.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Consistency of Design:</span> The app consistently uses right arrows or colored text to indicate when collection titles are links. Item collection pages have an identical interface layout for borrowing options, across all types of items, (magazines, audiobooks, and ebooks), although corresponding text differs. The app consistently uses the back arrow to indicate exiting a page, along with the page title to which the user will be redirected. The app does not require swiping to the side to see carousels of additional content- rather, clickable links to full collection pages are provided.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Use of Color:</span> The app uses green and magenta highlights for content, in addition to black and white.  The app also incorporates the colors of the library through which a user is borrowing to its interface; for example, Jersey City Free Public Library users see certain pages in blue and yellow.  The menu navigation icons also change to color from black and white, when a page is selected.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Additional Comments:</span> Book cover images, and other image content consistently load correctly and rapidly.  The apps browsing page displays book covers both as selections of 6 titles, and in a chevron pattern, as opposed to in a long list of multiple carousels.  Libby also allows users to hide specific collections that they do not want to see from their browsing homepage, and provides clear instructions for how to restore them, if accidentally removed, or if users change their mind. The app often provides written explanations for users of various terms, such as the “skip the line” feature, and how to explore using filters on first use.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Overall Impressions:</span> Libby’s user interface is easily customizable in settings, and also uses color, graphics, and varying means of arranging content, in a manner which uniquely identifies the app from other content tools such as social media, and provides a visually dynamic experience.  Subjectively, the app’s user interface strikes an effective balance between being usable, and displaying content in a simple and straightforward manner, and being visually appealing.</p>

		   			<h2>Reviewing UX:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Reviewing the user experience of the software and the design decisions that contributed.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Testing Across Devices:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Understanding how the software design is impacted when viewing on different devices such as mobile, tablet, or desktop.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Non-English Language Use:</h2>
		   			<p>SimplyE is the end-user interface of Library Simplified, which connects e-book hosting and distribution services with library catalogs and management systems. Due to this, it is compatible with materials using Adobe's DRM, with audiobooks using Findaway and Overdrive's audiobook rights management. While SimplyE can display non-encrypted PDFs, it cannot render Adobe-encrypted PDFs or PDFs that include proprietary extensions or commercial licensing. SimplyE also cannot read Kindle Books, which are protected by Mobipocket DRMs that are proprietary to Amazon.</p>

		   			<h2>Translations</h2>
		   			<p><em>Availability of translations within the software.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Ease of Use:</h2>
		   			<em><ul>Analyzing the ease of use of the software by conducting a set of specific tasks outlined below:
			   			<li>Browse books, search a specific book, and borrow it</li>
			   			<li>Create a bookmark</li>
			   			<li>Exit the software and to same page in the book you were reading</li>
			   			<li>Try to find the borrowing limit and max it out</li>
			   			<li>Return a book</li>
						<li>Examine data for borrowing history and attempt to delete that data</li>
		   			</ul></em>
