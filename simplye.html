		   			<p><em>SimplyE is an app that is part of Library Simplified, a library collective that was started by the New York Public Library and nine partners. It aims to build a national e-content marketplace where patrons can discover, borrow, and read books in one place.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Testing for Accessibility:</h2>
		   			<p><em>We explored different accessibility features and applied filters to determine the how accessible the software is.</em></p>
		   			<p>SimplyE's app does not feature any accessibility options or tools for its home page, but it functions with a screen reader for all categories and buttons. The text size scales based off of screen size, with a relatively generous font size. However, the text color is somewhat low contrast compared to the background, leading to possible difficulties reading it without any additional options.</p>
		   			<p>After opening a book, SimplyE offers a choice of three color schemes- dark, light,and sepia. Font size can be scaled up or down between 8 different sizes, and brightness settings can also be adjusted. There is an option between three different fonts- serif, sans serif, and OpenDyslexic as well as the publisher's default. However, there are no options for line spacing or font weight. However, SimplyE is compatible with screen readers, and the text within the books is high contrast and easily distinguishable from its background in all 3 color schemes. When run through the red/green, blue/yellow, and grayscale color filters, all of the results appeared clearly.</p>

		   			<h2>Reviewing UI:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Reviewing aesthetic and graphic choices for consistently designed user interface.</em></p>
		   			<p><em>Note: this portion of usability testing was conducted by a member of the team who accessed the app in their capacity as a Jersey City Free Public Library cardholder.</em></p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Font:</span> The app uses legible fonts, which are identical or similar across the platform. Notably the selected font, is very similar, if not identical, to the fonts used as the default for other popular applications, such as spotify, and instagram.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Use of Graphics:</span> The app utilizes very sparse graphics - the app’s navigational menu features a gear, e-book page, and column-building, such as that which is often used to indicate an institution or repository as graphics.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Consistency of Design:</span> The app consistently uses a back arrow, and the word back to indicate returning to a page, and the word “more” accompanied by an ellipses to indicate the possibility of clicking to see more content, across its interface. The app also uses color and outlines or verbal cue to indicate functions such as book borrowing.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Use of Color:</span> The app consistently utilizes a simple color palette of dark green, gray, black and white. Notably the app is configured to change colors when users’ phones are put on “dark mode”. i.e., a dark green bar becomes light gray so that it is still readable.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Additional Comments:</span> The app makes the edge of subsequent content visible on the right edge of all book carousels, which helpfully indicates the possibility of swiping to see further content. When content, particularly book cover carousels, do not load correctly, they are distractingly temporarily replaced by a distracting moving striped bar, which is visually distressing for some users. The app also uses random graphics for covers which lack an official image, which notably the app does not allow customization of the overall user interface in its settings, however, it is possible to change aspects of the resources such as font size, page color, and brightness within the books themselves. </p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Overall Impressions:</span> The overall visual interface of SimplyE, lives up to the application’s name, as the content is displayed without excessive color, graphics, filters, or options. Interestingly, SimplyE and Hoopla are in many ways visually similar, which may make users of multiple e-reader applications more familiar or comfortable with the applications’ use. For users who are focused principally on the app’s available content, overall SimplyE provides a visually streamlined interface. However, for users who would like an experience which feels tailored to the function and type of app in question, they may want to select a different choice.</p>

		   			<h2>Reviewing UX:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Reviewing the user experience of the software and the design decisions that contributed.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Testing Across Devices:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Understanding how the software design is impacted when viewing on different devices such as mobile, tablet, or desktop.</em></p>

		   		<div class="column">

		   			<h2>Content Acquisition & Digital Rights Management:</h2>
		   			<p>SimplyE is the end-user interface of Library Simplified, which connects e-book hosting and distribution services with library catalogs and management systems. Due to this, it is compatible with materials using Adobe's DRM, with audiobooks using Findaway and Overdrive's audiobook rights management. While SimplyE can display non-encrypted PDFs, it cannot render Adobe-encrypted PDFs or PDFs that include proprietary extensions or commercial licensing. SimplyE also cannot read Kindle Books, which are protected by Mobipocket DRMs that are proprietary to Amazon.</p>

		   			<h2>Translation & Non-English Language Use:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Evaluation of translation and app usability in languages other than English</em></p>
		   			<p><em>Note: This evaluation was conducted by a French-speaking member of the team, using e-book accounts to which they have access as a member of the Jersey City Free Public Library</em></p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Is it clear how to change language settings in the app?</span> No</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Is it possible to change language settings in the app, and if so, how?</span> No</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">If a user’s phone has a default language other than English, will the text in the application’s interface be consistently written in the language of their choice?</span> No - see next question</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Are all sections of the application’s content, including text for buttons or imported headings translated?</span> No navigational content is translated. Headings, menu selections, and informational settings pages are still displayed in English.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Does viewing the app in a language other than English impact the layout of the app’s user interface?</span> N/A - text is not translated.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Are there foreign-language options for content in the app? (Note: the number of resources available on the e-reader applications surveyed is in part dependent on the library’s overall collection policies).</span> Yes! For example, SimplyE provides ebook options for many resources which are in the public domain, thus when searching in French, resources such as texts written by Marcel Proust were available for borrowing.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Does searching for content in the application, actually yield options in the user’s language of choice?</span> Yes, when searching by both subject terms or keywords, and popular author names in the language-of-choice, it was possible to find content in the sought language. The search interface also yields titles which contain the searched for keywords in the resource’s description and not just the title, creator, or other descriptive metadata, which is particularly helpful.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Overall Impressions:</span> Overall, SimplyE is a fun choice for readers searching for foreign-language content, because of its inclusion of works in the public domain, which are accessible through the app, even by users without a library account which specifically provides SimplyE access. However, the reality that the navigational content of the app was not translated at all, unfortunately means that this content will remain less accessible to non-english speakers, who may otherwise find the resource valuable.</p>

		   			<h2>Ease of Use:</h2>
			   		<em><p>Analyzing the ease of use of the software by conducting a set of specific tasks outlined below</p></em>
			   		<p><span class="subtitle">Browse, select a book, and borrow it:</span> The app uses a tiny Headphones graphic to distinguish ebooks and audiobooks when browsing, which is easy to overlook. The app uses multiple terms for borrowing activity: “download”, “Reserve” and “get”. The difference between these functions is not explained, although it appears that the download option refers to public domain ebooks. It is also difficult to determine from the books’ pages if the book has been successfully borrowed or downloaded. It is not possible to see the borrowing time window-limit for books or to read samples prior to borrowing.</p>
			   		<p><span class="subtitle">Make a bookmark:</span> In a book, users tap the bookmark icon in the top right corner. It is easy to accidentally unclick bookmarks on each page. Note- the list of bookmarks users make is nested within the table of contents section within books, which can be hard to find without exploring.</p>
			   		<p><span class="subtitle">Close the app and return to the same page in a book:</span> When users close the app on the page of a book and re-open the app, it is necessary to navigate across several pages back into the book, but the last page does come up. It is not possible to search for keywords within a text to navigate to specific parts.</p>
			   		<p><span class="subtitle">Try to find the app’s borrowing limit, and max it out:</span> The app does not specify users’ borrowing limits. By searching online, on the user’s library’s website we were able to find the limit.</p>
			   		<p><span class="subtitle">Return a Book:</span> It is not possible to delete downloaded public domain books from the app. It is easy to return borrowed books using the return button within users’ “my books” page.</p>
			   		<p><span class="subtitle">Examine your data from previous borrowing and delete it:</span> It is not possible to see users’ previous borrowing data in SimplyE.</p>
