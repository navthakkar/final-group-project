		   			<p>introduction to software + its use</p>

		   			<h2>Testing for Accessibility:</h2>
		   			<p><em>We explored different accessibility features and applied filters to determine the how accessible the software is.</em></p>
		   			<p>Libby's app both features many accessibility options yet forgoes others. The home page of the app, when run through the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE), notes that there are instances of no alt text, extremely small text, and lack of heading structure and other structural elements.</p>
		   			<p>Through a desktop view, there is no way to change the color scheme to one other than the default dark mode, and there are no options for text size as well. (Libby2 Image) However, once a title is borrowed and the built-in e-book reader function opens, many options for accessibility opens up. Users are able to change the color scheme from three different options- dark, light, and sepia. Text size is also fully customizable with a large range of options. Users are able to change the font, line spacing, and text weight of their book, including several preset options. One of these preset options is labeled as OpenDyslexic, which utilizes the OpenDyslexic font in combination with generous line spacing in order to create a more readable experience for dyslexic people.</p>
		   			<p>Libby also includes additional accessibility options such as color variation reduction, text variation reduction, motion reduction, and vibration reduction. When run through a color filter, the high contrast nature of Libby's design leads to easily readable text with red/green filters, blue/yellow filters, and grayscale filters.</p>

		   			<h2>Reviewing UI:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Reviewing aesthetic and graphic choices for consistently designed user interface.</em></p>
		   			<p><em>Note: this portion of usability testing was conducted by a member of the team who accessed the app in their capacity as a Jersey City Free Public Library cardholder.</em></p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Font:</span> The app uses a variety of legible fonts, for example, using different fonts for headings, and filter options.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Use of Graphics:</span> App pages such as the settings page, feature book or swirling line graphics. The apps’ main navigational menu graphics are not necessarily visually communicative. For example, users may not interpret 3 horizontal lines to mean “settings”.  However, the graphics are specific to the app’s function; for example, a stack of books graphic indicates borrowers’ virtual shelves.The app also uses an appealing library card graphic in borrowers card management page, and across the app, as another point of entry to books’ borrowing pages.  The app also features a libby icon on users’ settings pages which is customizable; users can adjust the icon’s skin tone by clicking on it.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Consistency of Design:</span> The app consistently uses right arrows or colored text to indicate when collection titles are links. Item collection pages have an identical interface layout for borrowing options, across all types of items, (magazines, audiobooks, and ebooks), although corresponding text differs. The app consistently uses the back arrow to indicate exiting a page, along with the page title to which the user will be redirected. The app does not require swiping to the side to see carousels of additional content- rather, clickable links to full collection pages are provided.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Use of Color:</span> The app uses green and magenta highlights for content, in addition to black and white.  The app also incorporates the colors of the library through which a user is borrowing to its interface; for example, Jersey City Free Public Library users see certain pages in blue and yellow.  The menu navigation icons also change to color from black and white, when a page is selected.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Additional Comments:</span> Book cover images, and other image content consistently load correctly and rapidly.  The apps browsing page displays book covers both as selections of 6 titles, and in a chevron pattern, as opposed to in a long list of multiple carousels.  Libby also allows users to hide specific collections that they do not want to see from their browsing homepage, and provides clear instructions for how to restore them, if accidentally removed, or if users change their mind. The app often provides written explanations for users of various terms, such as the “skip the line” feature, and how to explore using filters on first use.</p>
		   			<p><span class="subtitle">Overall Impressions:</span> Libby’s user interface is easily customizable in settings, and also uses color, graphics, and varying means of arranging content, in a manner which uniquely identifies the app from other content tools such as social media, and provides a visually dynamic experience.  Subjectively, the app’s user interface strikes an effective balance between being usable, and displaying content in a simple and straightforward manner, and being visually appealing.</p>

		   			<h2>Reviewing UX:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Reviewing the user experience of the software and the design decisions that contributed.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Testing Across Devices:</h2>
		   			<p><em>Understanding how the software design is impacted when viewing on different devices such as mobile, tablet, or desktop.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Non-English Language Use:</h2>
		   			<p>Libby's title availability is based off of the library card that the user has in their possession. While some libraries offer the ability to find titles that aren't in their collection and request that they be added, many libraries do not. As a subsidiary of Overdrive, Libby's collection also depends on their availability through Overdrive. Overdrive grants users a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable non-commercial personal license to their content. Users may copy, transfer, and burn content for non-commercial personal use, but cannot redistribute, resell, or download content to public terminals. Overdrive purchases digital distribution rights from publishers, and then sells lending rights to libraries. Due to these lending rights have expiration dates, they are generally more expensive than print books.</p>

		   			<h2>Translations</h2>
		   			<p><em>Availability of translations within the software.</em></p>

		   			<h2>Ease of Use:</h2>
		   			<em><ul>Analyzing the ease of use of the software by conducting a set of specific tasks outlined below:
			   			<li>Browse books, search a specific book, and borrow it</li>
			   			<li>Create a bookmark</li>
			   			<li>Exit the software and to same page in the book you were reading</li>
			   			<li>Try to find the borrowing limit and max it out</li>
			   			<li>Return a book</li>
						<li>Examine data for borrowing history and attempt to delete that data</li>
		   			</ul></em>
