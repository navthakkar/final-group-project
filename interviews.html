		   			<p><em>Notes:</em> Given the time constraints of this project, and the availability of local reference librarians, the research team was unable to conduct extensive interviews.  The size of sampling of the below data should not be viewed as a valid sample size, or representative of American Reference Librarians’ experiences.  Rather the qualitative data gathered by this project can best be utilized as an anecdotal supplement to the project’s usability testing, and an intriguing point of departure which may inform future research.  The names and respective branches of the librarians interviewed have been anonymized to ensure their personal and professional privacy.  Given the small number of responses provided, results have been amalgamated and paraphrased.</p>

		   			<h2>Role in Vendor Decision Making Process:</h2>
		   			<p>Of the reference librarians we spoke to, they noted that in their roles they were not directly responsible for the decision making process for selecting vendor applications their libraries would offer to patrons, but they had been consulted for input during the decision making process, given their roles as patron-facing staff.</p>
		   			<p>The suggestions reference librarians make to patrons requesting e-books are constrained by the policies for e-reader application licensing set by their institutions, which may itself be constrained by their library’s role in a consortium. Where possible, the interviewed librarians mentioned that they will take into account patrons’ intended purpose, and disability status when suggesting specific tools to meet their needs, rather than a particular preferred application or tool.</p>

		   		</div>

		   		<div class="column">

		   			<p>The librarians we spoke to noted that they often do not bring up the possibility of accessing library content through applications during reference interactions, unless they are specifically prompted by the patrons.</p>

		   			<h2>FAQs from Patrons</h2>
		   			<p>In general, patrons tend to express confusion about limits to the number of resources they can borrow at once.   The interviewed librarians noted that patron questions and confusion tends to be correlated to their overall technoliteracy skills. One librarian noted that as patrons have become more familiar and comfortable with application use in their daily life over time, patron confidence with troubleshooting application issues seems to have improved.</p>

		   			<h2>Personal Use of E-readers</h2>
		   			<p>The interviewed Reference Librarians’ personal use and experience of e-reader apps varied, and were dependent on personal preferences for the reading experience.</p>

		   			<h2>Impact of the Pandemic</h2>
		   			<p>While the size of electronic collections in Public libraries seems to have increased during the pandemic due to reallocation of budgets to accommodate shifting user needs during lockdown, overall the interviewed librarians did not feel that their personal perspectives on e-reader applications had shifted.</p>
